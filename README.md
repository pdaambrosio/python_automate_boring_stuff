# python_automate_boring_stuff

Tasks from the book I read a long time ago

## Description

This repository contains the tasks from the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.
The book is a great resource for beginners to learn Python and programming in general.
The tasks are divided into chapters and are solved in the Jupyter Notebook

## Considerations

This is a personal repository and is not intended to be used for commercial purposes.
The tasks are solved by me and are not intended to be used for cheating or other dishonest purposes.
The book is a greatest resource for beginners to learn Python and programming in general. I highly recommend reading it.
And I removed my personal data from the tasks, so you can use it as a reference for your own tasks.
In all chapters, I commented the code (Portuguese) and added some explanations to make it easier to understand.
